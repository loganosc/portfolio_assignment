        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          George Peacock, a Chapel Hill entrepreneur, launched NeoPay in 2024 to solve a problem crushing small businesses across America: credit card processing fees that can devour up to 3.5 percent of every transaction. While large retailers negotiate rates as low as 1 percent, independent shops face fees two to three times higher. These fees  have only quietly grown more complex and expensive over the past two decades. Peacock's solution cuts these costs by 50 to 80 percent while rewarding customers with cash and prizes, proving that the current system doesn't have to be the only option.        </p>

        <h2>Video Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This story examines economic inequality in payment infrastructure and how the digital convenience reshaping the way Americans spend money is quietly changing how small businesses must survive. Each tap or swipe is accompanied by a fee, and for many small businesses, those little charges add up to be a serious financial burden. What seems like an efficient transaction to consumers often translates into a painful cut in revenue to the business, especially when margins are already very slim.         </p>

        <p>
          <br>Each digital transaction passes through multiple intermediaries: issuing banks, card networks like Visa and Mastercard, and payment processors. Each step has fees for authorization, fraud protection, risk management, and infrastructure maintenance. These interchange fees began modestly decades ago but have grown increasingly complex as the payment network expanded. The structure varies by card type, processor, and business size, creating an uneven landscape where identical transactions cost different merchants vastly different amounts. Over a year, a small business processing $500,000 in card payments at 3 percent loses $15,000 to fees: money that could fund employee raises, inventory expansion, or simply help the business survive.        </p>

        <h2>Disparity</h2>
        <p> Large corporations negotiate much lower processing fees because their transaction volume gives them leverage. Small businesses rarely enjoy such benefits. Many receive the highest rates in the system with little to no bargaining power to challenge them. Where a big retailer may pay 1 to 1.5 percent per transaction, an independent shop pays 2.5 to 3.5 percent for that same exchange. Premium rewards cards, the ones consumers love for cash back and travel points, are often the most expensive for small merchants to accept. We get rewarded while the business absorbs the cost.</p>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Digital convenience is now an expectation, not an option. The fees that seem invisible to consumers tapping their cards represent real money that small business owners must absorb, often forcing impossible choices between competitive pricing and financial sustainability. This isn't just inefficient; it's a structural barrier that makes small business survival harder in an already challenging retail environment. George's work with NeoPay shows how one person can push back, help their community, and hopefully end the hidden
          pressures behind every transaction.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Working on this project helped me understand how complex digital payment systems are and how difficult they can be for small businesses to navigate. As a team member of Neopay, working alongside George Peacock and learning about his journey to build NeoPay has shown me what it really means to be a helping hand in our community. I went into the assignment knowing that these fees existed on a basic level, but I did not realize how many layers and institutions were involved or how much the fee structure favors large companies over small ones. Translating that information into a clear narrative took time because the topic is very technical and often confusing. The more I learned, the more appreciation I grew for George and his startup. I am excited to see how it is able to successfully impact merchants in our community and hopefully others eventually as well!
