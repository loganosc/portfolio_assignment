        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Credit-card and digital wallet fees seem invisible until they stack up at the end of the month. For this
          package I set out to make the hidden costs tangible, walking readers through real stories of small retailers,
          bakeries, and service providers who are navigating higher interchange rates while trying to stay transparent with
          their communities.
        </p>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Video Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I led with a short video explainer to ground the topic before diving into the data, pairing narration with
          footage from local shops and animated overlays that unpack how processing fees accumulate.

        <h2>Article Body</h2>
        <p>
          The written package is structured in concise, scannable blocks. Each paragraph pairs a grounded story with a data
          point so the narrative stays empathetic without losing the economic stakes.
        </p>
        <div class="muted-panel">
          <p>
            Paragraph two highlights how restaurants facing thin margins have to decide between absorbing fees or raising
            menu prices. Owner interviews revealed that customers often confuse processing surcharges with price gouging.

            <h3>Paragraph Three</h3>
            <p>
              I break down state-by-state rules on surcharging and cash-discount programs, linking to a compliance checklist
              so owners can avoid fines while staying transparent with customers.

          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Paragraph Four</h3>
            <p>
              The final block explores design interventions—like receipt annotations and in-store signage—that keep
              customers informed and reduce frustration at checkout.

        <h2>Infographic</h2>
        <p>
          A full-width infographic visualizes how a 2.9% + $0.30 fee structure impacts businesses at different average ticket
          sizes. It also contrasts processor markups to demystify “discounted rates.”

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Reflection & Closing</h2>
        <p>
          The package closes with a short reflection that frames processing fees as a systemic challenge rather than a
          merchant failure. By pairing reporting with approachable visuals, the goal is to give owners language to advocate
          for themselves—whether negotiating with processors or educating their neighborhoods.
