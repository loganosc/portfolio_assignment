        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          DinkLink connects recreational and competitive pickleball players through a simple profile,
          matchmaking, and messaging experience. The goal was to reduce friction for pick-up matches
          while highlighting the stats and context players need to feel confident when reaching out.
        </p>
        <div class="case-grid">
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Local players struggled to discover partners who match their skill, schedule, and preferred courts.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>A streamlined flow that surfaces nearby players, courts, and recent results in one glanceable feed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>Clearer onboarding, stronger profile signals, and faster conversations increased successful match requests in testing.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
        <p>
          I interviewed five recreational players and mapped their current tools: text chains, Facebook groups,
          and ad-hoc spreadsheets to track scores. The common friction points were confidence in a partner’s skill,
          knowing which courts were free, and coordinating logistics without endless back-and-forth.
        </p>
        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Players needed a quick read on skill level, preferred times, and recent matches.</li>
          <li>Court availability and distance were key deciding factors when accepting an invite.</li>
          <li>Messaging needed to stay lightweight, with match details attached to avoid confusion.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Design Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I built the interface in Figma with a focus on clarity: minimal chrome, strong typography, and
          modular cards that keep stats, partners, and court info aligned. I kept the visual language calm and
          confident so newcomers feel welcome while advanced players still get the details they expect.
        </p>
        <div class="case-grid">
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Profile clarity</h3>
            <p>Progression badges, win/loss summaries, and common availability quickly communicate fit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Matchmaking</h3>
            <p>Filters for distance, skill tier, and preferred format reduce the time to find a partner.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Messaging</h3>
            <p>Contextual threads attach location, time, and gear notes so players stay on the same page.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Solution Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          The final flow centers around a home dashboard that balances discovery with action. Players can move from
          browsing to inviting in under three taps while keeping court logistics transparent.
        </p>
        <div class="case-grid">
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Home feed</h3>
            <p>Nearby partners, suggested courts, and recent matches appear in a single vertically scrollable stream.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Match request</h3>
            <p>Quick-select time blocks and skill tiers auto-populate invites to cut down on coordination messages.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-card">
            <h3>Stats & history</h3>
            <p>Lightweight charts surface momentum without overwhelming casual players.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-callout">
          Building around reusable cards meant the system stayed consistent across the dashboard, player profiles, and court pages,
          making handoff easy and keeping the learning curve low.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section page-section-inner">
        <h2>Outcomes & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          Testers were able to create a profile and send their first invite in under three minutes. For a next iteration,
          I plan to pilot a lightweight availability calendar and integrate local club schedules.
